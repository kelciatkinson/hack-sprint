      "bio": "Hello there! My name is Snow White, and my life is anything but ordinary. I feel like it’s important to add that I’m a bit of a package deal. I have seven dwarven partners with whom I live with in a tiny cottage somewhere deep in the woods. There’s never a dull moment in this humble abode. As far as interests are concerned, I am a lover of all things nature and animals. In my free time I enjoy singing, baking pies, and embarking on enchanted woodland adventures.",

      "bio": "Yo! My name is Wolf, but most call me Big. I’m sure you’ve heard of me before. I’m a very independent individual, and I like to spend my time by ponds. I believe that the stillness brings calm, as well as provides some of the clearest and truest reflections of, you know, myself. I’m a pretty deep thinker and I tend to be steps ahead of anyone else. Another activity I enjoy is to not only huff, but also puff. You wouldn’t believe the causation of these uncommon skills. I like to see myself as a protector and a doer. You’ll be safe with me.",

I enjoy taking strolls by a moonlit pond, talks full of dreams, both past and present and playing my Lute. If you aren’t interested in music, there’s no way we can harmonize. If you’re looking for your happily ever after, I’m ready to begin our story.",

People love me, as I am precious as I am fun, which is very. I am looking for an individual who isn’t afraid to have fun and embrace their inner child. The more adventurous, the better. Another thing that’s most important to me is that you have enough time to spend with me. I don’t mind how, be it admiring me, appreciating me, doting on me. What can I say? I just love to be seen! I enjoy spending time flying through the night sky. If you’re unable to fly on your own, no worries, I have just the dust to help. Hehe!",

My personality can be best compared to that of my sword, “bright, sharp, and speedy”. In my freetime I enjoy a swift sword fight, a tall glass of milk, or saving yet another kingdom from its own demise. I’m looking for someone as charming and likable as myself, but not too much so. It’s also important to me that my love can keep up with my fast pace in life. Talk soon!",
